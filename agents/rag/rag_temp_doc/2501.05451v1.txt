We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and p-wave
superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional
(2D) p-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that
the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a d−wave
altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting
state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition
into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs). On the
other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topo-
logically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov
quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that
when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical
components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge that modes
coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for
controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing
total magnetization.
I. INTRODUCTION
Altermagnetism, a recently established form of mag-
netic order, bridges the gap between ferromagnetism and
antiferromagnetism [1–3]. While exhibiting zero net mag-
netization, a characteristic often associated with antifer-
romagnets, it simultaneously induces spin-split electronic
band structures—a hallmark of ferromagnetism. This
unique feature has sparked significant interest within
both theoretical and experimental condensed matter
communities [1–22]. The intriguing nature of altermag-
netism extends further since its textures manifest as
higher-harmonic orders in momentum space (e.g.,d−, f−,
g−wave), thus providing the previously lacking magnetic
analogs to unconventional superconducting (SC) orders,
such as p−, d−, f−wave, etc. This opens exciting av-
enues for exploring novel material properties and func-
tionalities, which requires further understanding of the
underlying mechanisms governing altermagnetism and its
potential applications.
The realization of one- and two-dimensional (2D) topo-
logical superconductors has been a key impetus in the
study of topological phases of matter, driven by the goal
of creating localized Majorana zero modes, which are
considered as fundamental building blocks for topolog-
ical quantum computation [23–30]. Furthermore, there
has recently been growing interest in gapless topological
superconductors from both theoretical and experimental

perspectives [31–39], which may host zero-energy Majo-
rana flat edge modes (MFEMs) instead of isolated Majo-
rana zero modes, with a very recent experiment reporting
the signature of MFEMs in a magnetic-superconductor
hybrid system composed of Fe/Ta(110) [31]. We here
present an alternative approach to introduce gapless
topological superconductors hosting MFEMs, along with
other new topological superconducting (TSC) phases, by
invoking an unconventional SC platform involving an al-
termagnet, therefore carrying a net zero magnetization,
that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been explored
until now.
To this end, we here consider the simplestd-wave alter-
magnetic order parameter (OP) in the presence of both
chiral and helical p-wave SC states. We demonstrate
that coupling the altermagnetic OP with this uncon-
ventional superconductor can give rise to several novel
TSC phases. In the case of a helical p-wave supercon-
ductor, altermagnetism drives the system from a heli-
cal gapped topological superconductor to a gapless topo-
logical superconductor that hosts MFEMs. In contrast,
for a chiral p-wave superconductor, a topological phase
transition occurs, featuring the transition from a chiral
gapped p-wave topological superconductor to a gapless
nodal-line superconductor in the presence of altermag-
netism. Notably, for a mixed p-wave superconductor,
combining helical and chiral SC OPs, altermagnetism in-
duces an unusual hybrid topological phase where both
dispersive and flat Majorana edge modes coexist. Finally,
this work reveals a tunable altermagnet-unconventional-
superconductor platform that can support both gapless
topological superconductivity, and a hybrid TSC phase
that features coexisting dispersive and flat Majorana

edge modes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
we introduce the model for the 2D altermagnet with d-
wave magnetic ordering coupled with unconventional he-
lical and chiralp-wave superconductors. Next, we present
numerical results on the edge states using the nanorib-
bon termination in the square lattice geometry in Sec. III,
with the results for the edge state spectrum and the lo-
cal density of states (LDOS) shown in Sec. III A and
Sec. III B, respectively, for the chiral and helical phases,
while in Sec. III C we discuss both the edge states and
LDOS in the case of mixed pairing phase. In Sec. IV, we
compute the bulk gap profile as a signature of a topo-
logical phase transition by analyzing the corresponding
lattice model. Finally, we summarize and discuss our
results in Sec. V.
II. MODEL AND METHOD
We here consider the Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG)
Hamiltonian, representing an interplay between alter-
magnetism and 2D p-wave superconductor with helical
and chiral order that can be written as,
H = 1
2 ∑
k
Φ†
khkΦk, (1)
where the four-component Nambu spinor is Φ k =
(ck↑, ck↓, c†
−k↑, c†
−k↓)
⊺
, where ck↑(c†
k↓) is the annihilation
(creation) operator of the quasiparticle at momentum k
and spin up (momentum −k and spin down), with
hk = ξkτzs0 + J(k)τ0sx + ∆h
p(τys0 sin kx − τxsz sin ky)
+∆c
p(τxsx sin kx − τysx sin ky). (2)
Here, the electron quasiparticle dispersion is ξk =
−2t (cos kx + cos ky) + 4t − µ, with µ as the chemical po-
tential. Furthermore, we assume that altermagnetic OP
possesses d-wave symmetry,
J(k) =2JA (cos kx − cos ky), (3)
with the amplitude of the altermagnetic order JA [2, 5,
14, 40]. The helical and chiral superconducting OPs are
∆h
p and ∆c
p, respectively [41–45]. The Pauli matrices τi
and si, i = 0, x, y, z, act on particle-hole space and spin
space, respectively. We obtain the spectrum correspond-
ing to the helical superconductor, given by the Hamilto-
nian in Eq. (2), as
ϵk =r
√
ξ2
k + J(k)2 − 1
2(∆hp)2(cos 2kx + cos 2ky) + sF(k).
(4)
For chiral superconductor, on the other hand, since the
SC piece of the Hamiltonian commutes with the alter-
magnetic OP, the spectrum takes the form
ϵk =rJ(k) + s
√
ξ2
k + (∆cp)2(sin2 kx + sin2 ky), (5)

where r, s= ± are the band and particle-hole index, re-
spectively. The form of F(k) reads as
F(k) =2J(k)
√
ξ2
k + (∆hp sin kx)2, (6)
and the topological phase transitions therefore take place
for the critical strength of the altermagnetic OP,
Jc
A =±1
4 ∣4t − µ∣, (7)
with band gap closing at the high-symmetry points X =
(π, 0) and vice versa.
We show the band structure [Eq. (4)] in Fig. 1 for
a helical p-wave superconductor. Notably, a topological
phase transition occurs at the amplitude of the altermag-
netic OP JA = Jc
A, as given by Eq. (7), separating two
distinct topological states. For J <Jc
A, the system is al-
ways in a gapped, topologically non-trivial phase due to
the presence of the helical p-wave superconductivity [see
Fig.1(a)]. In contrast, for J > Jc
A, a new topologically
non-trivial phase emerges, leading to gapless topologi-
cal superconductivity [see Fig.1(c)], which hosts MFEMs.
This new phase features an even number of gapless nodes
[see Fig.1(d)], therefore representing a weak topological
superconducting phase [46, 47], since it can be viewed
as a stack of one-dimensional superconductors in class D
(without time-reversal symmetry) changing the topolog-
ical invariant at the (gapless) nodal points.3

to the case (c). The values of parameters are µ = 2t, ∆c
p = t,
and ∆h
p =0, with t =1, in Eq. (2).
In Fig. 2, we display the band structure (using Eq. (5))
for a chiral p-wave superconductor. We observe a topo-
logical phase transition at JA = Jc
A, where for JA < Jc
A,
the system is in a gapped, topologically non-trivial phase
with broken time-reversal symmetry. On the other hand,
for JA >Jc
A, the system features a gapless nodal line su-
perconductor (see Fig. 2(c)), where the closest to zero
energy Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect along a
line in the Brillouin zone, with the corresponding form of
the Fermi surface displayed in Fig. 2(d). Therefore, for
a chiral p-wave superconductor, the d-wave symmetry of
the altermagnet drives the system from a gapped topo-
logical phase to a gapless nodal line superconductor. In
the following section, we discuss the signatures of these
nodal superconductors in terms of the edge states.
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we discuss numerical calculations based
on the lattice model implemented in real space given by
the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1).
A. Edge states in ribbon geometry
The numerical calculations of the edge states in the
ribbon geometry are performed by employing periodic
boundary conditions (PBC) along the x-direction and
open boundary conditions (OBC) along the y-direction.
FIG. 3. Edge states in the ribbon geometry for a helical
and chiral p-wave superconductor coupled to the altermag-
net [Eq. (2)]. (a) [(b)] Helical p-wave superconductor for the
altermagnet coupling JA = 0.3t [JA = 0.65t]. (c) [(d)] Chiral
p-wave superconductor for the altermagnet couplingJA =0.3t
[JA = 0.8t], respectively, for a chiral p-wave superconductor.
We employ open [periodic] boundary conditions along y [x]
direction and µ =2t is fixed.
We first show the spectrum of the edge states for the
helical p-wave superconductor for JA < Jc
A [JA > Jc
A], in
Fig. 3(a) [Fig. 3(b)]. For JA < Jc
A, the system exhibits
helical edge states protected by time-reversal symmetry,
as shown in Fig. 3(a). On the other hand, the system
leads to three flat edge modes for JA > Jc
A [shown in
Fig. 3(b)], indicating six gapless points in the momentum
space, as displayed in Fig. 1(d). This result closely paral-
lels findings in the study of magnetic textures within hy-
brid superconductor systems [34], featuring the SC pair-
ing with d-wave symmetry. Notably, in our context, the
d-wave symmetry of the altermagnet plays a key role in
facilitating gapless topological superconductivity, which
is conducive to the emergence of MFEMs in helical p-
wave superconductors.
In a chiral p-wave superconductor, the ribbon geom-
etry, as expected, supports two chiral edge channels for
a small magnitude of the altermagnet OP JA < Jc
A, as
displayed in Fig. 3(c). On the other hand, for the over-
critical amplitude, JA > Jc
A, the behavior changes dra-
matically as the edge modes become delocalized. Such a
change in the band structure is a consequence of the tran-
sition to a nodal line superconducting phase, character-
ized by the presence of the isolated lines in the momen-
tum space where the superconducting gap closes. The
emergence of this phase is further corroborated by the
plot of the corresponding (gapless) nodal lines in Fig.

FIG. 4. Panels (a) and (b) show local density of states
(LDOS) at zero energy (E =0) of the helical p-wave supercon-
ductor coupled to the altermagnet (Eq. (1)) for the values of
the altermagnet amplitude JA = 0.3t and JA = 0.65t, respec-
tively. Panels (c) and (d) display LDOS at E =0 of the chiral
p-wave superconductor for the coupling constant JA = 0.3t
and JA = 0.8t, respectively. The inset in each panel shows
the spectrum of the closest-to-zero-energy states in the corre-
sponding phase. We here set µ = 2t and ∆h
p = ∆c
p = 1.0, and
t =1.
B. Local density of states
To elucidate the presence of the Majorana modes in
this system, we now calculate the LDOS, following the
approach outlined in Refs. [32–34]. The quasiparticle
LDOS for the ith site at a given energy E reads
ρi(E) =∑
nσ
(∣un
iσ∣2 + ∣vn
iσ∣2)δ(E − En), (8)
where un
iσ and vn
iσ are the electronlike and holelike quasi-
particle amplitudes, respectively. Here, n and σ are the
eigenvalue and spin indices, respectively.
We first consider a helical p-wave superconductor. In
Fig. 4, we calculate the LDOS ρi(E) at zero energy
(E = 0) in the xy plane by employing OBC along both
the x and y directions, using the lattice Hamiltonian in
Eq. (2) in real space. We then find close-to-zero-energy
dispersive edge modes that are maximally localized along
the two edges of the system for JA < Jc
A, as shown in
Fig. 4(a), with the plot of the eigenvalues in the in-
set of the same figure. In the helical case, altermag-
netism drives the system from hosting dispersive Ma-
jorana modes in the regime of subcritical altermagnet
amplitude to featuring MFEMs when JA > Jc
A. Inter-
estingly, these zero-energy MFEMs are again maximally
localized only along the two edges of the system, shown
FIG. 5. Nearly flat band edge mode driven by altermagnet
in the presence of a mixed helical and chiral superconductor.
Panels (a) and (b) show ribbon spectrum for a mixed super-
conductor when the altermagnet amplitude is below (JA <Jc

structure undergoes the transition. Panels (c) and (d) depict
corresponding zero energy local density of states for JA <Jc

and JA >Jc
A, respectively. We set the parameters µ =2t and
∆h
p =∆c
p =t, with t =1, in Eq. (1).
in Fig. 4(b), with the closest-to-zero-energy modes shown
in the inset.
For a chiral p-wave superconductor, when JA <Jc
A, as
expected, dispersive Majorana edge modes are highly lo-
calized along the four edges of the system, as shown in
Fig. 4(c). In contrast, in the case of strong altermag-
net OP JA > Jc
A, the edge modes disappear, i.e., they
become completely delocalized, as shown in Fig. 4(d),
and the bulk enters the nodal line SC phase, consistent
with previous analyses of the band structure and the edge
states.
C. Mixed topological phase
We now analyze the topological edge states and the
LDOS arising from the interplay between d−wave alter-
magnet and a mixed pairing superconductor with both
chiral and helical p-wave components.
In Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), we show the ribbon spectrum
calculated under the PBC along the x direction and
OBC along the y direction. The spectra reveal dispersive
edge modes in the regime of the subcritical altermagnet-
superconductor coupling, JA < Jc
A, which are character-
ized by both linear and quadratic dispersions, as illus-
trated in Fig. 5(a). Notably, for JA > Jc
A, the system
transitions to a mixed topological phase, which supports
both linearly dispersing and nearly flat edge modes, as5
FIG. 6. The bulk gap (∆) as a function of the chemical potential ( µ) and the amplitude of the altermagnet order parameter
(JA) for helical, chiral, and mixed (helical-chiral) p-wave superconductors, shown in panels (a), (b), and (c), respectively. The
color bar encodes the size of the gap. We set the parameters ∆ h
p = t (∆c
p = t) in the helical (chiral) phase, while in the mixed
phase ∆h
p =∆c
p =t in Eq. (1), with t =1. The system size is N =30 × 30 sites.
depicted in Fig. 5(b). This should be contrasted with the
behavior of the edge states observed in the pure chiral
and helical superconducting phases, as shown in Fig. 3.
The features of the mixed phase are further corrob-
orated by the E = 0 LDOS shown in Figs. 5(c) and
5(d), where the zero-energy state is highly localized along
the edges of the finite system, with the closest-to-zero-
energy states depicted in the inset. This suggests that
the d−wave symmetry of altermagnetism facilitates the
formation of this mixed topological phase, which accom-
modates both dispersive and flat edge states in the pres-
ence of mixed helical and chiral p−wave pairings. Such
behavior is clearly distinct from that observed in either
the purely chiral or helical phase, as can be observed in
Fig. 4.
IV. GAP PROFILE
In this section, we analyze the variation of the bulk
gap profile by employing PBC along both the x and y
directions as a characteristic signature of the topological
phase transition.
As an indicator of the topological phase transition,
in Fig. 6, we show the maximum value of the gap,
∆ =∣E2 − E1∣, between closest to zero energy Bogoliubov
quasiparticle bands, where E1 (E2) represents the maxi-
mum (minimum) of the energy of the negative (positive)
energy band. Fig. 6(a) displays the gap, ∆, as a func-
tion of the altermagnet strength JA and chemical poten-
tial µ for the helical p-wave superconductor. For a fixed
(nonzero) value of µ, we observe that this gapped topo-
logically non-trivial phase remains robust in the regime
JA < Jc
A, where Jc
A is the critical coupling for the phase
transition at the zero chemical potential. On the other
hand, for a strong altermagnet amplitude, JA > Jc
A, we
observe multiple topological phase transitions in terms
of the chemical potential, with the bulk gap closing and
reopening. Each gap closing point corresponds to a gap-
less topological superconducting phase hosting MFEMs,
as depicted in Fig. 3(b).
In Fig. 6(b), we display the outcome of an analogous
analysis for a chiral p-wave superconductor. For a fixed
value of µ, we observe a topological phase transition
from a topological chiral gapped superconducting phase
to a gapless nodal-line superconducting phase, see also
Fig. 3(d). Finally, in Fig. 6(c), we show the maximum
gap ∆ in the µ − JA plane for a mixed p-wave supercon-
ductor. Interestingly, in this case, we also find multiple
topological phase transitions between gapped and gapless
phases, which is a clear indication of a mixed topologi-
cal phase that hosts MFEMs and dispersive edge states,
shown in Fig. 5(b).
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In summary, we investigated the effect of ad-wave sym-
metric altermagnet texture on a 2D helical and chiral
p-wave superconductor. For a helical p-wave supercon-
ductor, altermagnetism drives the system from a heli-
cal gapped topological superconductor to a gapless topo-
logical superconductor hosting MFEMs. However, for
a chiral p-wave superconductor, such a coupling yields
a topological phase transition into a gapless nodal line
superconductor. Most interestingly, for a mixed (helical-
chiral) p-wave superconductor, altermagnetism induces a
new hybrid topological phase where dispersive and flat
Majorana edge modes coexist.
Our findings, particularly, the predicted gapless topo-
logical phase and MFEMs may be relevant in light of a re-
cent experimental proposal [31], where a gapless topolog-6
ical superconducting phase hosting MFEMs in a magnet-
superconductor heterostructure composed of Fe/Ta(110)
has been identified. Here, we propose an alternative
method to engineer gapless topological superconductivity
hosting MFEMs in an altermagnet and unconventional
superconductor hybrid system. Specifically, the potential
experimental setup realizing our scenario involves RuO2,
a leading candidate for altermagnetism withd-wave mag-
netic order [1], fabricated on top of a topological p-wave
superconductor, such as UTe2 [48]. This heterostructure
could serve as a promising candidate for engineering gap-
less topological superconductivity hosting MFEMs. Al-
though this remains experimentally challenging due to
the limited availability of topological p−wave supercon-
ducting materials, our study opens new avenues for engi-
neering gapless, and, particularly, hybrid topological SC
states, wherein Majorana dispersive and flat edge modes
coexist within an unconventional SC platform with zero
net magnetization.
